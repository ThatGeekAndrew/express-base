# Express Base

A quick & easy go-to for building MEAN-style applications with a few opinions baked in.

## Motivation

A lot of the templates that I've found are too old (using deprecated technologies like [Bower](https://bower.io/)) or don't conform to my style of development. I use a very predictable set of technologies and very rarely stray from the essentials unless what I'm building calls for a different stack.

## Features

* Express 4
* Bootstrap 4 Beta.2
* Font Awesome 4.7
* jQuery 3.2
* Angular 1

In the future I expect to be adding:

* Server/Browser reloading when changes are saved
* Asset delivery pipeline
* Unit Testing
* Optional features (templating, frontend packages, etc)


## Installation

I suggest using yarn, although there shouldn't be any difference.  
After cloning this code, run:
```
yarn && yarn start
```

## Tests

No tests yet. Maybe someday in the future I won't be so careless!
